# Daily Coding Problem
My solutions for [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com)

Currently I have only added JS and Python solutions. But I plan on adding more in the future.

Problems exist in `problems` directory under each language directory. (ex: `./js/problems/`)

Unit tests are also under each language directory.

```
language/
    problems/
    tests/
```
